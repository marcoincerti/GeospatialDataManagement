# One day in Milan
I analyzed a google maps file containing my whereabouts.

A file with 12,000 records that Iâ€™ve cleared, analyzed, and processed.
Like this:

```yaml

{
    "latitudeE7": 445382795,
    "longitudeE7": 107784641,
    "accuracy": 8,
    "velocity": 0,
    "heading": 310,
    "altitude": 119,
    "verticalAccuracy": 6,
    "deviceTag": 152086288,
    "platformType": "IOS",
    "serverTimestamp": "2022-04-14T10:32:51.644Z",
    "deviceTimestamp": "2022-04-14T10:32:51.346Z",
    "batteryCharging": false,
    "formFactor": "PHONE",
    "timestamp": "2022-04-14T10:32:48.026Z"
  },
  ```
From the position I went up to the ferry through the timestand, and then to the speed of the move.
Finally, I set threshold values to see if:

* I was still
* I was walking
* I was using the meter 
* I was using the train
